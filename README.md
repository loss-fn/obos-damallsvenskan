## OBOS Damallsvenskan predictions

These are some attemtps at predictions for OBOS Damallsvenskan that I'm working on together with [@paronglass](https://github.com/paronglass). The purpose is to try out and learn more about programming, math and machine learning topics and be able to apply them.

**Current season:**

2020: We're working on a probabilistic model to predict the outcome of the games. It's a simple formula with a few parameters per team which are combined with the opponent's parmeters to produce a predicted outcome for a match.  

**Previous:**

2019: We started the prediction project during the autumn break with just a few matches left of the season. We ended up with a Random Forest Classifier in Python using scikit-learn and pandas.
