## OBOS Damallsvenskan 2019 predictions

These are the notes for a small ML project that I'm doing with my daughter (Eowyn, 12 years old).

#### Wasting time worrying about football

We find ourselves in the rather serious situation that, as of writing this (3rd of October 2019), our favourite team _Kopparbergs/Göteborg FC (KOP)_ in [OBOS Damallsvenskan 2019](https://obosdamallsvenskan.se) is in second place. FC Rosengård (FCR) is in first place and with 3 matches to go there's really no way they can realistically miss out on being champions.

But, there are two spots for the next season of [UEFA Women's Champions League](https://www.uefa.com/womenschampionsleague/) and that's what we're worried about missing. Especially since the final will be played in our hometown of Gothenburg next year.

_Standings as of Round 19 (2019-09-29)_
```
FCR  19  13   1   5  46  12  34  44  # Rosengård are basically champions already. Congrats. Well done.
KOP  19  10   3   6  39  17  22  36  # But we'd really like to keep this place, please!!
VIT  19  10   5   4  28  12  16  34  # <- This is worrying,
KRI  19   9   4   6  38  22  16  33  # <- ... to say the least.
ESK  19   9   6   4  27  18   9  31
PIT  19   7   3   9  23  16   7  30
LFC  19   8   6   5  28  16  12  29
ÖRE  19   8   8   3  21  24  -3  27
VÄX  19   5   8   6  21  36 -15  21
LIM  19   3  11   5  16  40 -24  14
DIF  19   3  15   1  18  44 -26  10
KUN  19   1  16   2  13  61 -48   5
```
As you can see there are at least two (VIT and KRI), maybe even four or five teams (if we include ESK, PIT and LFC) that can mess things up for us by snatching that second place spot. And, since there's a break for [Euro qualifiers](https://www.uefa.com/womenseuro/) right now there's nothing better to do than to speculate, worry and learn some basic Python programming and Machine Learning concepts while we're at it.
